    <h1>Privacy Policy — PERFECT PITCH Piano Tuner</h1>
    <p class="effective-date">Effective date: January 10, 2026</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>PERFECT PITCH Company</strong> handles information when you use the PERFECT PITCH Piano Tuner PRO and LITE mobile applications (the “App”).</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect and Use</h2>
    <p>We do not require you to create an account, and we do not directly collect, store, or see any personal information such as your name, email address, or location.</p>

    <h2>2. Microphone Access and Audio Processing</h2>
    <p>The App requires access to your device's microphone to detect the pitch of your piano strings.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>On-Device Processing:</strong> All audio analysis is performed strictly on your device in real-time.</li>
        <li><strong>No Recording or Transmission:</strong> We do not record, save, or transmit your audio to any servers.</li>
        <li><strong>External Devices:</strong> The App supports routing audio through Bluetooth speakers, headphones, or earbuds for your convenience, but the processing remains local to your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Advertising (LITE Version)</h2>
    <p>The LITE version of the App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. To show these ads, AdMob may collect and use certain data, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device Identifiers:</strong> Such as your Android Advertising ID.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Your device model, operating system version, and IP address (used to determine approximate location for localized ads).</li>
        <li><strong>Ad Interactions:</strong> Information about which ads you see and whether you click on them.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is collected directly by Google. You can manage your ad preferences or opt-out of personalized advertising through your Android device settings (Settings > Google > Ads).</p>
    <p><strong>The PRO version of the App has no ads.</strong></p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your data. The only data "shared" is the technical information automatically collected by Google AdMob to serve and measure the performance of advertisements within the App.</p>

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is a utility for musicians and is not specifically directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by an updated "Effective Date" at the top of this page.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
